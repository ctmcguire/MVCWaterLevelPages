						The Mississippi Valley Conservation Authority monitors stream flow, meteorological conditions, operational conditions at the 
						dams and water quality.  The information is collected and transmitted from each station to the MVCA's Operations Centre in 
						Carleton Place, Ontario.  Once an hour the data are summarized and posted to this web site.

					A number of factors will influence the accuracy of real-time water level and flow data including;
					<ul>
						<li>
							backwater from ice, weeds or debris,
						</li>
						<li>
							malfunctioning equipment and/or routine maintenance of equipment may cause data spikes, and
						</li>
						<li>
							sediment accumulation may lead to plugged intake.
						</li>
					</ul>

					A number of factors will influence the accuracy of real-time rain fall data including;
					<ul>
						<li>
							funnels and instruments may become fouled with debris or insects,
						</li>
						<li>
							the tipping bucket mechanism may malfunction, and
						</li>
						<li>
							the tipping bucket rain gauge may not properly record precipitation during freezing weather conditions.

					A number of factors will influence the accuracy of real-time water quality data including;
					<ul>
						<li>
							Water quality probes may become fouled with sediment or debris, and
						</li>
						<li>
							malfunctioning equipment and/or routine maintenance of equipment may cause data spikes.

						River levels and flows can change rapidly in response to water entering the river as a result of rainfall or snowmelt, 
						or changes in discharge from the major reservoirs operated by the MVCA.

						Users of the MVCA's real-time data are cautioned to consider the provisional nature of the information before using it for
